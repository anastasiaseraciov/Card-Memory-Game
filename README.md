## Contributing

The starter project was given by Udacity as part of Front-End Web Development Nanodegree and has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
